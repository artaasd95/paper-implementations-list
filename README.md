## 🎯 Research Philosophy

> *"The best way to understand a breakthrough is to rebuild it from scratch."*

Each implementation in this collection represents not just code, but a journey of understanding—from the first read of the paper to the final working system. Through this process, we uncover the nuances, challenges, and insights that only come from hands-on experience.
